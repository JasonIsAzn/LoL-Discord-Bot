# LoL-Discord-Bot
LoL Discord Bot is a personal Discord Bot written in Python. This project is my experience to learn RIOT API, REDDIT API, Web scrapping, databases, and overall improving my coding skills.  When playing League of Legends, information is critical to gaining an advantage on your opponent. This bot's main function is to provide user with information about League of Legends whether it's simple profile information to live in-game statistics.  This discord bot also provide other function such as obtaining the latest news, memes, anime, and any addition functions that members of the discord suggest.
